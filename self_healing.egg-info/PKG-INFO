# Self-Healing Library

The Self-Healing Library is a Python tool that dynamically runs and patches code to recover from runtime errors using installed data.

## Features
- Execute arbitrary Python code safely
- Catch and analyze runtime errors
- Automatically find solution for errors

## Installation
```bash
pip install self_healing
```

## Usage
```python
from self_healing import check_code()

sample_code = """
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

result = divide(10, 0)
print(result)
"""

check_code(code=sample_code)
```

## Roadmap
```
- AI-powered code fixes
- AST-based code patching
- Interactive debugging prompts
```
